# Factorial Problem

Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. The factorial of n (written as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

For example:
- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
- 0! = 1 (by definition)

Your task:
1. Implement a factorial function
2. Test it with the input n=10
3. Explain the result
